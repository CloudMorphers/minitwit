    \section{Abstract}
    Initially, when we took over MiniTwit, it was a Python-based application built with the Flask framework. We then began replacing it with a new implementation using ASP.NET Core. As some group members already had experience using C and found that it had a nice ecosystem. All other members had experience with Java but wanted to learn C, we felt this was a beneficial decision for both the project and our learning as students. This was a complete rewrite, as it involved changing both the frontend and backend technology stacks and re-implementing functionality from scratch.
